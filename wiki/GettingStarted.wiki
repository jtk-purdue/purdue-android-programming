#summary Getting started with Android programming.

= Getting Started =

Did you miss the "Overview" talk by Tony Hillerson?  Here are the steps necessary to get caught up with the rest of the class.

= Preparing for the Workshop =

If you do not have an account on the CS machines, send me [mailto:jtk@purdue.edu email].

If you have a laptop, you may want to use it rather than one of the lab machines.  You'll need the Java SDK, the Android SDK, Eclipse, and the Android Development Tools (ADT).

  * [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/] (get eclipse-java-galileo-SR1-linux-gtk.tar.gz)
  * [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html]

If you can come a few minutes early, we can help you get set up.

= Walk-Through =

Here are the steps to take you through the basics, starting in the instructional lab in the Lawson Building, LWSN B158 (Linux with KDE).

  * Launch Eclipse (in Applications/Development).
  * Create a workspace (preferably in a fresh directory).
  * If necessary, set the Android SDK location in Eclipse:
   * Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Android -> SDK Location
   * /opt/android-sdk-1.6
  * Create a new Android project
   * File -> New -> Other -> Android -> Android Project -> Next
   * Project Name: Simple Flashlight
   * Build Target: 1.6 (same as Android G1 phones we have)
   * Application Name: Simple Flashlight
   * Package Name: com.oreilly.simpleflashlight
   * Activity Name: RedFlashlightActivity
