= Android Programming Workshop â€” Purdue Local Arrangements =

Interested in Java programming on the Android phone?  O'Reilly is sponsoring an online tutorial workshop:

  * [http://training.oreilly.com/androidapps-java/ Developing Android Applications with Java]
  * Instructor: Tony Hillerson
  * Tuesdays at 2:00 EST, February 9-March 16, 2010

I am arranging a "local viewing party" to watch the sessions live and offer help, answer questions, and provide additional material as necessary.  I will have a limited number of Android G1 phones to try out (you can also use the emulator).

Local (Purdue) viewing:

  * LWSN B158

If you are interested in participating, register at the site above and let [[mailto:jtk@purdue.edu|me]] know (so I can make sure we have enough room).  If you miss the first session, that's probably OK--we can catch you up.
