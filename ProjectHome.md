This site is for members of the Purdue community who are learning Android programming: Share code, ask questions, and exchange ideas.

The current community activity is an Android programming workshop sponsored by O'Reilly and delivered online.

  * [Developing Android Applications with Java](http://training.oreilly.com/androidapps-java/)
  * Instructor: Tony Hillerson
  * Tuesdays at 2:00-4:00 EST, February 9 through March 16, 2010

The Purdue group meets in LWSN B158 for a "local viewing party".  We offer help, answer questions, and provide additional material as necessary.  We also have a limited number of Android G1 phones to try out (in addition to using the emulator, of course).

If you missed the first week, [here](http://code.google.com/p/purdue-android-programming/wiki/GettingStarted) are instructions to get you "caught up".

Be sure to join the Purdue Android Programming [group](http://groups.google.com/group/purdue-android-programming) to get on the mailing list.
